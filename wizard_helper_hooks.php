 */

/**
 * Define what wizards your module implements.
 *
 * @return array
 *    An array of wizards with the information for each wizard witin each array
 *    entry.  The key for the array should be actual hook_menu paths that will
 *    be defined to handle the form submissions of your wizard.  The menu "title",
 *    "access callback", and "access arguments" can be defined within each entry.
 *    The parameters that can be provided by each wizard is defined as follows.
 *

 *      - object name (optional): The name of the object within the $form_state
 *        to pass around to each of the wizard pages.
 *      - path (optional): The path to the directory that contains your wizard.  This
 *        defaults to a folder within your module whose name is the "id" above.
 *      - form id (optional): The form id name to provide for the wizard form.

 *
 *    After you have defined your wizards, you then will need to create a folder
 *    in which your wizard will reside.  Each page of the wizard will get its
 *    own file within the wizard which should be named {MODULE}_{PAGE}.inc.
 *    Please see the sample module for more information.
